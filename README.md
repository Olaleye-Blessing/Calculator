# Calculator

A calculator app with basic caltulating features.  
It is built on top of my previous attempt at creating a calculator. I reused some components (keypad, button, display) and rewrite the logic using functional components, state and effect hooks.  
Some react.js caltulators use `eval()` for operation. I decided against it because of [security concerns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!).  
"It is slightly less pretty than my last one, but more functional"

## languages/framework
This app is made with React.js.

## Roadmap
+ Adjust style
+ fix known bugs
+ refactor the code and logics


## Bugs
Known bug(s):  
+ display may not work properly if you input larger digits of number.
+ operations may not work properly when chaining multiple operations together

Please report bugs and how they occur if you encounter any.
